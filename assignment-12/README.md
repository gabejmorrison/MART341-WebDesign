Padding is the area between the subject of the box and its border. It'd be like the "padding" that comes in a box when you order a new PC monitor online.
Margins are the space that's allocated around the outside of the border of the box.
Borders are the edge of the specific box or element. They can be solid or dotted, or not visible altogether.

I had a lot of challenges this week, and ultimately couldn't get the project to be the way that I wanted it to be which was disappointing. The fish was strong willed, and absolutely refused to be eaten (or placed by the bear's mouth which was my objective). The drop down menu was really difficult to get to function properly as well, but it eventually worked. I also had some confusion about sizing the images which was frustrating since I thought that I was able to do it seamlessly in the past.

A document can have as many tags in the head and body as necessary. They are different because the elements within the head are not directly visible to the viewer of the page, whereas the elements in the body are what make up the content of the page.

Structural markup is like the skeleton of the page. These are the paragraphs and headers, etc. The semantic markup is like the skin on the bones, the things that change the way that the information is interpreted, like underlining or italicizing the text.

So far there hasn't been too much that's difficult, but this is a placeholder that I hopefully will not have to return to soon in order to edit and explain what severely messed me up.

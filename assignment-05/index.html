    <h1> The Butter Battle </h1>
    <h2> Dr. Seuss </h2>
    <hr/>
    <p> The Butter Battle is a story of arms race escalation, in which two cultures that disagree on something as trivial as which side of their toast should be buttered start to attack each other. <br />
      Eventually both groups develop "nuclear weapons," in a metaphor for the mutually assured destruction of The Cold War era. <br />

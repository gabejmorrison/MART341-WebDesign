# Website That I visited

I thought that it would be most interesting to go back and look at the older versions of Youtube, since I remember that being one of the first websites that I used. I also remember several times throughout the years being very disappointed whenever they'd update the look of their website, and being frustrated that things got moved around or changed. For instance, there was a time when the Watch Later function was removed from the website, which really bothered me for a long time before it eventually returned. I was surprised to see how different the website looked in 2011, and even as recently as 2015 when it just wasn't nearly as aesthetically pleasing or organized.

At the moment, only one of my links works. The link from the about page to the index page works, but not the other way around. I couldn't figure out how make it work- when I copy and paste the link into the search bar on my browser it works, and then I paste it into the html line and update everything and the link still doesn't work. I know I'm using the correct link. The line of code is as follows:
 <a href="https://gabejmorrison.github.io/MART341-WebDesign/assignment-05/about.html"> To learn about the author </a>
 Oh, nevermind it works now. That's strange, I didn't change anything. Well I'll leave the paragraph above as a relic of what had been my biggest struggle with this assignment.

Read Me for Week 14:

1) I used Bootstrap.
2) I used a CDN to link to the library, because it seemed more flexible.
3) HTML5 makes the web more secure, allows for offline resource support, and includes cool new features like drag and drop, and camera integration!
4) It was confusing for me to understand what the libraries/frameworks do, and I wasn't sure how the several you included on the website related to eachother. The canvas component was pretty intuitive to me and I'm excited to make more "art" in the next project, but I had to change my expectations for what I thought I'd be capable of including with Bootstrap once I realized how complicated it was. The icons I included on the pages were more than enough for a struggling artist such as myself.

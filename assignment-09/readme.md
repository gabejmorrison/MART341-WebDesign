I had no prior experience learning HTML before this class which was concerning to me, but I think that it was paced very well for the success of people like me. Certain things were more difficult to learn though, but in general it was the more conceptual stuff- like understanding what the heck github even was. I didn't really understand what the site was, or how the programs we're using (Atom, Github Desktop, etc.) related to each other. Understanding how to format the depositories was strange, but I guess that's just the experience when learning any new language. It's like how once you can sort of speak Spanish, learning a new word or phrase is just a matter of memorizing that word or phrase, but in the first days of learning it the broader ideas like when to end a word with an "a" or an "o" seems impossibly daunting.

I'm anxious about learning CSS, because it seems like learning an entirely new system on top of this house of cards that is 9 weeks of experience with html is a little spooky. I'm sure it'll be fine though after the initial difficulties.

This seemed like a really challenging assignment since it combined so many concepts all at once, and at first when I started it was a little bit frustrated and overwhelmed but piece by piece it started to come together which was a really satisfying feeling.

  <p>I chose the topic of being happy because it's what most of my energy has been spent on this past year. 12 months ago I was about as low as a person could ever be, but I decided to make some drastic changes. Of course the three tips on the <a href="./index.html">Home</a> page of this website are not exhaustive, they're just some of the most important discoveries I've made. They seem obvious, but for some reason they're difficult to impliment. It's a universal desire of almost every living thing though to be happy, so it's strange just how difficult it really is.

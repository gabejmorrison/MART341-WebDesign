    <h3>The first piece of advice:</h3>
    <p>One of the most important things to strive for in the pursuit of happiness is growth. <br>
      A person who remains static in what they do is likely to start feeling a variety of emotions: inadequacy, jealousy, contempt, boredom. Being able to recognize opportunities for growth is very important. They're usually difficult to commense or agree to, but either the end result will be what you desired, or the embaressment/ failure will be an important lesson ofr the future. A person who wants to be happy should beware of going too long without a new experience, whether it be something small like trying or cooking a new cuisine, or something larger like developing a friendship with somebody completely different from the types of people you usually spend time with.

    <h3>The second piece of advice:</h3>

    <p>I don't think that it's a coincidence that I spent the first two decades of my life being more inactive than any homo sapiens before me, and simultaneously depressed. I'd recommend being active to anybody, and at risk of sounding overly-dramatic, it really did save my life. This can take on many forms. Maybe for one person, they can play sports for a few hours a week and feel good, for another they might need to run every day. What works for me is a weight-lifting routine that's 6 days a week, repeating the same PPL cycle twice from Monday to Saturday with Sunday as a rest day. This has been invaluable in creating confidence and pride for me, it's allowed me to be more social and less uncomfortable in my own skin.</p>

    <h3>The third piece of advice:</h3>
    <img src="./images/heart.png" alt="Picture of a heart" title="Heart"/>
    <p>It's so easy to be negative, especially towards ourselves. My default state has always been to essentially bully myself, to say something awkward aloud and then follow it up with internal dialogue along the lines of "holy crap, I'm such a pathetic, worthless piece of garbage." That's a no. I heard a piece of advice once that you ought to talk to yourself like you would a friend. If your friend made a mistake, even if it was detrimental to you personally, you'd probably say something like "it's alright, it happens to the best of us." Redesigning the way that you speak to and love yourself is one of the most important steps towards being happy.

      <h4>Benefits to being kinder to yourself:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You'll internalize the change in tone, and regrets/ mistakes will not feel as daunting</li>
        <li>You'll become kinder in general, more accepting of others</li>
        <li>What you accept yourself to be capable of will adapt, and you'll feel less limited in what you can do</li>
        </ul> <br />

The universal selector type is used when you want to make a change to the style of everything all at once. The element selector type is used to affect every element of a certain type, like a paragraph or heading. Classes would be used when you want to make sweeping changes to a specific grouping of elements within one class, and the id would be used when wanting to make changes to one specific thing like one paragraph among many.

I used a different set of three colors for each film. For the James Bond section I thought that these three colors would look good together based on their usage in the poster:
 #B22222
 #FFD700
 and rgb(255, 255, 224) which I wrote out in that way in order to be able to change its opacity.
 For the 2001 portion I used the colors:
 #000000
 #C0C0C0
 and #FF0000

The main challenge I had this week was in trying to figure out how to apply stylistic changes with css to specific headings. I couldn't figure out how to apply changes to an h1 within a certain div without them applying to other h1's, and so the workaround I employed was to just give the h1's individual ids, which worked but I assume isn't a particularly viable workaround in general since there may be scenerios where there's hundreds of things that a web designer would want to stylize on an individual basis.
